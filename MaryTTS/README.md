# MaryTTS (Hass.io Addon)

The MaryTTS system as Hass.io Plugin, to integrate it nicely in the homeautomation. 

## Configuration

The default Voicepacks for `de`, `en`, `fr`, `Ã¬t`, `lb`, `ru`, `sv`, `te` and `tr` are included.

There might be the option to add a own voice pack via configuration. For now there are just them.

## UI

The Demo-UI of MaryTTS can be accessed via `http://<hassio-address>:59125`.
